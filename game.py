# ASK FOR A USER INPUT AND WELCOME TO GAME

print("Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!")

n = input("What is your name? ")

print("Welcome to the game,",n)

u = input("Please choose one of 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors': ")

r = ["ROCK","rock","Rock"]
p = ["PAPER","paper","Paper"]
s = ["SCISSORS","scissors","Scissors"]

#could have also put print("USER CHOSE:" u) but wanted to unify case

if u in r:
    u = "rock"
    print("USER CHOSE: rock")
elif u in p:
    u = "paper"
    print("USER CHOSE: paper")
elif u in s:
    u = "scissors"
    print("USER CHOSE: scissors")
else:
    print("Invalid selection. Please try again!")
    quit()

# VALIDATE THE USER CHOICE

valid_input = ["rock","paper","scissors"]

#by fixing the case above, I integrated the data validation


#Failing gracefully is integrated with the data validation


# COMPUTER CHOICE

computer_choices = ["rock","paper","scissors"]

import random
c = random.choice(computer_choices)
print("COMPUTER CHOSE:", c)

# DETERMINE THE WINNER

if u == c:
    print("It's a draw! You both chose",u)
elif u in r:
    if c in p:
        print("Sorry! Paper covers rock. You lose.")
    else:
        print("Congrats! Rock crushes scissors. You won!")
elif u in p:
    if c in r:
        print("Congrats! Paper covers rock. You won!")
    else:
        print("Sorry! Scissors cuts paper. You lose.")
elif u in s:
    if c in r:
        print("Sorry! Rock crushes scissors. You lose.")
    else:
        print("Congrats! Scissors cuts paper. You won!")

print("Thank you for playing! Please play again!")
